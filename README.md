# UGCTechDemo
A tech demo for user-generated content management in Unity.

## Goals
- [ ] Runtime asset importing. This could be either local files (FBX, PNG, JPG, OBJ, etc.) or AssetBundles (rather than patching game files)
- [ ] File register to manage allowed asset formats
- [ ] Addon manager with a user interface
- [ ] Git support to download addons
